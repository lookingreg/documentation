# Roadmap

Our goal is to create a service that will allow web3 developers (and even advanced users via no-code GUI) to create and use data sources, triggers and actions by writing them from scratch or by using a library of pre-made ones.

### Now <a href="#now" id="now"></a>

We integrate and support your project on web3alert.io manually, using the information you provide such as triggers, project description, endpoints, etc.

We provide integration support and user support.

All your users receive free and unlimited (except for reasonable antispam restrictions) access to web3alert functionality: creating and managing subscriptions, sharing, preparing alerts on third-party sites (see [Integration example](integration-example.md)).

### Q4 2023 <a href="#q4-2023" id="q4-2023"></a>

By the end of the year, we plan to transfer the ability to create and configure projects to you - web3 project developers. To integrate notifications into your blockchain or dApp, we provide you with self-service for trigger management - Web3alert SDK.

It consists of:

* Engine documentation which describes how our engine executes triggers, how to write them, and provides examples.
* CLI-tool which allows you to connect to our service using API keys and manage triggers.

This will allow you as developers to:

* Add your project to Web3alert, add a description and other stylistic elements to it.
* Create triggers.
* Create templates - sets of triggers with preconfigured parameters.

### Q2-Q3 2024 <a href="#q2-q3-2024" id="q2-q3-2024"></a>

* Full self-service due to updates of UI, CLI, and accesses, which will remove most of the need to contact us.
* The ability for developers to create their own actions (similarly to IFTTT, Zapier) like new messengers, Google Sheets integrations, etc.
* Gradual open-source
* features related to sharing links and a library for creating such links in external frontends.

### Future <a href="#future" id="future"></a>

* new authorizations ways (auth0, web3 wallets)
* new actions similar to IFTTT, Zapier, or Google Sheets, send a transaction/call smart-contract
