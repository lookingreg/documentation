# Step 3. Test trigger

In the previous step, we created first trigger for our project. 

Now we need to test the trigger and make sure that everything works as intended.

First you need to set the conditions for testing the trigger. Open the trigger configuration file and add the `test` property to the pipeline. In the test it is necessary to specify the initial parameters of values (if they are needed for the trigger) and describe the output data of the initiator node.

```yaml
test:
  values:
    lower: 0
    upper: 100
  samples:
    - node: start
      objects:
        - now: "2023-11-10T00:00:00.000Z"
```

Now to make a test run of the trigger and check the result we need to call the following command:

```
web3alert trigger test ./my-first-trigger.yml my-first-trigger --trace trace.yml
```

The result can be checked in the created `trace.yml` file.
