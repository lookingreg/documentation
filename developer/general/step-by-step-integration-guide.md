# Step-by-step integration guide

**Step 1.** Explore Web3alert on your own or contact us to schedule a live demo, ask questions, etc \
Telegram - [@web3alertio](https://t.me/web3alertio) \
Email - info@web3alert.io

**Step 2**. Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/VoieigP1L2Xy4XBJ6), providing us with:

* endpoint 
* images (icons, alert image, etc)
* description of your project
* your contact details (preferably Telegram)

**Step 3**. Once we've contacted each other, send us a list of triggers for templates for your Web3alert project. **Templates** are sets of triggers prepared in advance with preset parameters and you can take a look at other projects’ templates at [Web3alert.io Templates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XEPs2VrQY\_H2\_zk5GyUT0jqTwaOquDnrjk8oznNl8Pg/edit#gid=413325086)​

If you have any requests for customization of how the data in triggers should look like (for example token denominations or links) send them too.

**Step 4**. We will add everything to the Web3alert developer environment ([dev.web3alert.io](https://dev.web3alert.io/)) and you will be able to test them.

**Step 5**. Migration to Production. After your approval, we will publish the project to [web3alert.io](https://web3alert.io/).

* You will be able to use links to your templates on your website or dapp (see the [Integration example](integration-example.md))
* It’s time to make announcements
* We can also prepare an article or video with instructions for your users.

Usually, the whole integration process takes 2-4 weeks.
